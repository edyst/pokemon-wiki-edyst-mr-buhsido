				Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
				published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
				media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
				Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
				and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also
				referred as the &quot;core series&quot; by their developers

					<h4>Water</h4>
					<p>
						Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with
						Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon.
						This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept
						easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over
						100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and
						other sea-dwelling creatures.

					<h4>Fire</h4>
					<p>
						Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with
						Water and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon.
						This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept
						easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the
						early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation
						starter is often a plus.

					<h4>Grass</h4>

						Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with
						Fire and Water, which constitute the three starter Pokémon.
						This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept
						easily to new players.Grass is one of the weakest types
						statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that
						are resistant to Grass moves.

						The AR game&#39;s potential for weight loss was a big part of

						for reporting that he&#39;d lost 65 pounds between July and

					&quot;Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y
					water-type starter Froakie. It has the ability to take on an
					appearance resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates
					throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and
					throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in
					two.&quot;

				<p>
					&quot;Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream,

				<p>
					&quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad
					backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and
					Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so
					lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like
					Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual
					appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag
					was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.&quot;

					&quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery

					flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes

			<h2 id="q-and-a">Q and A</h2>
			<p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you
						know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential
						for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the
						rodent&#39;s evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has
						an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast
						amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this
						species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
						Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
					</li>
					<li>Answer is Raichu</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic
						model you start your journey off with, but progressive
						upgrades are needed if you&#39;re looking to keep up with some
						of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If
						you&#39;ve made your way through any Pokemon game, you&#39;ve
						reached the point where you&#39;re presented with the most
						effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch,
						and no button mashing at all is required.
					</li>
					<li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

						Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same as those in the

						slightly different: in brief, things like effective or
						resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the
						main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought
						them slightly closer in line.
